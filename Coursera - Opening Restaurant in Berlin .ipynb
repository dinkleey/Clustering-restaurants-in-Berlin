After considering several Western European capitals for the opening of its first unit in the continent, the chain management has selected Berlin as the first stop. As part of a preliminary analysis of the HoReCa market, the management is looking at the main competition in the city, and where the competition is located. \n",

A complete map of these clusters is to be presented to the management to gain a preliminary understanding of the market and potential customers.  \n"
